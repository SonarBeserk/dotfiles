# DotFiles

My first attempt at creating common files for my systems. Only Linux is supported at this time. If I ever setup Windows the same way or get a Mac I will make some adjustments.

## Recommended Extensions (VSCode)

* Markdown All in One
* Markdownlint
* ShellCheck

## Setup Script

To install these files you need to run the `setup.sh` script. This file by default will not be executable, which can be fixed by running ``chmod +x setup.sh`.

## Uninstall Script
